#+title: magit-hutch: code-review agent for emacs and magit

`magit-hutch` is a code-review agent that runs inside emacs. Invoke it from a magit buffer and get a granular review around the files changed. This can be used as a developer-local review tool before code is published to third-party review harnesses.

* Installation

It uses the `llm` package under the hood, so a `hutch-provider` must be configured beforehand. We recommend using SOTA models only, since the output from cheaper models can be unreliable.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package magit-hutch
  :straight (:local-repo "/Users/kitallis/Code/adjaecent/magit-hutch")
  :config
  (require 'llm-claude)
  (setq hutch-provider
        (make-llm-claude :key (getenv "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
                         :chat-model "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929")))

* Usage

From any magit buffer, press =d R= to run a review on your changes.

* LLM-usage disclosure

Most of the UI code is written in an AI-assisted way, but carefully examined. The rest of the agent and operational code is largely hand-written.
